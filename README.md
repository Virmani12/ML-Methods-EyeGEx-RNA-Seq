### Contributors: Aman Virmani, Alex Kullman
02620 Final Project at Carnegie Mellon University

## Project Overview
Each Jupyter notebook contains the code implementing a different machine learning method performed using the EyeGEx database found on the GTEx Portal website. In order to run the code, download all files from this database in the same directory as the code files, and then they can be run following the steps in the individual notebooks.
